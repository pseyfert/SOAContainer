SOAContainer
------------

SOAContainer is a class that mimics the interface of std::vector as much
as possible. In fact, from a user's point of view, there is not too much
difference between a SOAContainer and an array of structure (AOS)
std::vector<Hit> where Hit is an old-style class/structure that we all
know. You can sort, push_back, emplace, insert, erase, reserve, size,
index and get iterators from a SOAContainer just like you would for the
AOS case.

To illustrate, I'll bring a very short example here (something more
realistic is in the test code in git). Consider a minimal point with an x
and a y coordinate. In the AOS case, you'd code:

class AOSPoint {
    private:
        float m_x;
        float m_y;
    public:
	Point(float x, float y) : m_x(x), m_y(y) { }
	float x() const noexcept { return m_x; }
	float y() const noexcept { return m_y; }
        void setX(float x) noexcept { m_x = x; }
        void setY(float y) noexcept { m_y = y; }
        // plus some routines that do more than just setting/getting members
	float r2() const noexcept { return m_x * m_x + m_y * m_y; }
};

typedef std::vector<AOSPoint> AOSPoints;
typedef Point& AOSPoint;

Then we can all use Points and Point as we know it. Unfortunately, the
memory layout is AOS, i.e. not what SIMD units like. Converting this to a
SOA layout is fairly easy, though:

#include "SOAContainer.h"

// first declare member "tags" which describe the members of the notional
// struct (which will never exist in memory - SOA layout!)
 namespace PointFields {
    using namespace SOATypelist;
    // since we can have more than one member of the same type in our
    // SOA object, we have to do some typedef gymnastics so the compiler
    // can tell them apart
    typedef struct : public wrap_type<float> { } x;
    typedef struct : public wrap_type<float> { } y;
};

// define the "skin", i.e. the outer guise that the naked members "wear"
// to make interaction with the class nice
template <typename NAKEDPROXY>
class SOAPoint : public NullSkin<NAKEDPROXY> {
    public:
        /// forward constructor
        template <typename... ARGS>
        SOAPoint(ARGS&&... args) :
            NullSkin<NAKEDPROXY>(std::forward<ARGS>(args)...) { }

        float x() const noexcept
        { return this-> template get<PointFields::x>(); }
        float y() const noexcept
        { return this-> template get<PointFields::y>(); }
        void setX(float x) noexcept
        { this-> template get<PointFields::x>() = x; }
        void setY(float y) noexcept
        { this-> template get<PointFields::y>() = y; }

        // again, something beyond plain setters/getters
        float r2() const noexcept { return x() * x() + y() * y(); }
};

// define the SOA container type
typedef SOAContainer<
        std::vector, // underlying type for each field
        SOAPoint,    // skin to "dress" the tuple of fields with
        // one or more wrapped types which each tag a member/field
        PointFields::x, PointFields::y> SOAPoints;
// define the SOAPoint itself
typedef typename SOAPoints::proxy SOAPoint;

From that point on, you can more or less so what you're used to with your
points, the SOA nature should largely be invisible. For example, the code

// normalise to unit length
for (AOSPoint p: points) {
    auto ir = 1 / std::sqrt(p.r2());
    p.setX(p.x() * ir), p.setY(p.y() * ir);
}

would require virtually no changes when going from the AOS point to the SOA
point class:

// normalise to unit length
for (SOAPoint p: points) {
    auto ir = 1 / std::sqrt(p.r2());
    p.setX(p.x() * ir), p.setY(p.y() * ir);
}

The fields (members) in a SOAContainer-contained object can essentially be of
any POD type or pointer type, and there can be as many as the compiler will
support - if you need something more specialised, it'll likely work, but may
need some tweaking...

A few notes at this point seem to be in order:

- The container is internally a tuple<std::vector<field_1_type>,
  std::vector<field_2_type>, ...>. Other containers that conform to
  std::vector's interface can be used. Wouter's StaticArray from DetDesc
  comes to mind (essentially a std::array plus a size with std::vector
  semantics) - with a little bit of work to bring it to comply with
  std::vector's interface, we can make that happen...

- The NAKEDPROXY object is internally a pair of pointer to SOAContainer
  instance and an index into it, and it supports assignment
  from/conversion to tuple<field_1_type, field_2_type, ...> and
  tuple<field_1_type&, field_2_type&, ...> (for std::tie to work).

  It also supports the get<0>(), get<1>(), ... syntax to retrieve the
  field for the first, second, ... field template argument to
  SOAContainer, and it supports the more friendly symbolic lookup with
  get<FieldTag>() I've used in the example above.
  
  You can take the "address" of such a proxy object and get a
  pointer/iterator, which, when deferenced/indexed yields back another
  proxy.

- Since NAKEDPROXY itself isn't too friendly on the user, all the proxies
  are "skinned" with something more pleasant, in our case, the SOAPoint
  skin class. If you prefer the "naked" or skinless appearance, there's a
  NullSkin class in SOAContainer.h.

In the test code in the repo, there's an example which essentially takes
the example of a Tf::LineHit, and implements the corresponding SOA class.

According to callgrind, gcc 4.9 with appropriate flags will autovectorise
a gain of around 25% over the AOS version when shifting hits along y
(based on a mock-up of updateNonOTHitForTrack in Tf/RecoFuncs.h).
Unfortunately, in clang 3.5, the SOA version is around 10% slower than
the AOS version - to be understood.

I've had a brief look at the assembly in both cases, and both compilers
struggle, spilling registers on the stack. Still, given the register
shortage, both autovectorise reasonably well. Moreover, I would expect
things to improve once we have StaticArray working because then the
starting addresses are not random (from new), but will have a fixed
offset from one member/field container to the next, and the compiler
could take advantage of that by not dragging around five-six pointers,
and using one pointer, and five-six compile-time known offsets... But
we'll have to see...

Future plans:
-------------
- improve documentation (Doxygen)
- clean up the interface
- investigate if supporting the std::initializer_list interface of
  std::vector makes sense (I think at one point I convinced myself that
  it does not, but I'm no longer so sure... ;)
- (longer term) provide a SOAView which at the same time could serve as:
  * a means to express a range of all fields in a SOAContainer, including
    skin
  * a means to select only some of the fields in a container, optionally
    adding a different "skin" to make working more convenient
  * a means of combining same-size ranges from different SOAContainers,
    as this will allow a neat way to augment information incrementally
    (by adding a new view) without having to drag around (and copy/fill)
    the fields that are only needed later (think of per-algorithm flags,
    clustering information, the projection field in PatFwdHit, and things
    like that)

Random notes on current status:
-------------------------------
- the typelist functions and what's built around it (especially
  recursive_apply_tuple) should be reviewed by someone who's familiar
  with functional languages and template metaprogramming

- somehow, I had hoped that I would be able to scatter/gather like
  Gerhard did with index_sequence, but I'm either not clever enough, or
  my use case is too complicated, so I had to go back to an old-style
  solution like recursive_apply_tuple... this is moderately ugly, so if
  someone has some better solution, please shout!

- the iterator/pointer classes come in two guises:

  * a const iterator class which is the base
  * a non-const iterator class which derived from the const one

  this is done because a POD non-const pointer can always be converted to
  a const pointer without trouble, while converting the other way needs a
  cast. (copy/move) construction is the same: creating a const pointer
  from a non-const one is valid (implicitly down-casting from derived to
  base), but the other way is forbidden

  I've been having some difficulty with operator-> which is a little less
  than straight forward - it seems to work well enough as is, but I'd
  like to scrutinize this part to make sure there's no trouble lurking
  there before I release this bit into the wild

- the SOAObjectProxy and SOA(Const)Iterator classes should be reviewed to
  see if the noexcept specification makes sense everywhere; swap should
  be reviewed, and swap_ranges implemented

- not sure if all the copy/move constuctors/assignment operators we need
  are there, or if we have too many (to be seen)

- I'm sure there's more that needs improving and cleaning up, so don't be
  shy and tell me... ;)
